# Physics Simulator 

During this semester, I would like to explore interactive software that
can simulate physics. The goal of the software is to
demonstrate the laws of physics using visualization. One would like to 
create physics through visualization rather through complex formulas.

This software would be great for teachers and students who are taking
a physics course or anyone else who is interested in the topic. 

Personally, I enjoy mathematics a lot and I thought a great way to 
apply mathematics to code (software) would be to develop a physics 
simulator.

The user will be able to interact with the simulation via buttons and
sliders. The user can adjust the parameters 
(e.g. gravity, friction, mass) to discover new behaviors that can arise
under the laws of physics.
